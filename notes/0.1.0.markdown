This is an initial release of sbt-javaversioncheck.
It's an auto plugin to enforce Java version in case your library needs support Java 6. If you forget to switch JDK, `publish` and `publishLocal` task will fail.

    lazy val fooProj = (project in file("foo")).
      settings(
        javaVersionPrefix in javaVersionCheck := Some("1.6")
      )
